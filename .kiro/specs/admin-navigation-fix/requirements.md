# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing critical navigation and deployment issues in the Lost and Found Android application's admin module. The app currently crashes when navigating between admin dashboard pages due to missing ActionBar configuration, and there are several other issues preventing proper deployment including data model mismatches and missing enum values.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Navigation Crash

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to navigate between different admin dashboard pages without the app crashing, so that I can access all admin features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin opens the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL initialize without crashing
2. WHEN the admin navigates between tabs (Dashboard, Items, Users, Donations, Activity Log, Notifications) THEN the system SHALL switch views smoothly without errors
3. WHEN the admin presses the back button THEN the system SHALL handle navigation properly without throwing IllegalStateException
4. IF the activity uses Navigation Component THEN the system SHALL properly configure the ActionBar or remove ActionBar-dependent navigation setup
5. WHEN the admin navigates to any fragment THEN the system SHALL display the correct title and navigation elements

### Requirement 2: Fix Data Model Mismatches

**User Story:** As an admin, I want the app to properly deserialize all data from Firestore, so that I can view complete information without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system reads LostFoundItem data THEN the system SHALL properly handle "lost found" field mapping
2. WHEN the system reads LostFoundItem data THEN the system SHALL properly handle "status" field mapping
3. WHEN the system reads ActivityItem data THEN the system SHALL properly handle "new found" field mapping
4. WHEN the system reads User data with role "Security" THEN the system SHALL properly deserialize the role without throwing exceptions
5. IF a field name in Firestore doesn't match the model THEN the system SHALL either map it correctly or ignore it gracefully

### Requirement 3: Add Missing Enum Values

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all user roles from the database to be supported in the application, so that existing data doesn't cause crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters a "Security" role in Firestore THEN the system SHALL deserialize it to a valid UserRole enum value
2. WHEN new roles are added to the database THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
3. IF an unknown enum value is encountered THEN the system SHALL either use a default value or log a warning without crashing

### Requirement 4: Improve Error Handling

**User Story:** As an admin, I want clear error messages when issues occur, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firestore deserialization fails THEN the system SHALL log the error with details and continue operation
2. WHEN analytics calculation fails THEN the system SHALL display partial data or a user-friendly error message
3. WHEN navigation errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error and show a toast message
4. IF the app encounters performance issues THEN the system SHALL log warnings about main thread work

### Requirement 5: Optimize Main Thread Performance

**User Story:** As an admin, I want the app to remain responsive, so that I can work efficiently without lag or freezing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app performs database operations THEN the system SHALL execute them on background threads
2. WHEN the app loads large datasets THEN the system SHALL use pagination to avoid blocking the UI
3. WHEN the app displays lists THEN the system SHALL use efficient RecyclerView patterns
4. IF the main thread is blocked THEN the system SHALL move heavy operations to coroutines or background threads
