# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a comprehensive admin module for the Lost and Found Android application. The admin module will extend the existing basic admin dashboard to include advanced user management, enhanced item management, donation workflow, data export capabilities, system activity logging, and push notification functionality. The module is designed for campus administrators to efficiently manage the lost and found system, monitor user activities, handle item donations, and communicate with users through notifications.

The admin module will provide administrators with complete control over the application ecosystem, including user access management, item lifecycle management (from reporting to donation), comprehensive audit trails, analytics, and direct communication channels with users.
