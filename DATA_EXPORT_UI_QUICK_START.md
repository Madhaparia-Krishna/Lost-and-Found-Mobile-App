## Troubleshooting

### Export Fails to Generate

**Possible Causes:**
1. **No data in date range** - Select a wider date range

3. **Insufficient storage space** - Free up device storage
4. **Network error** - Check internet connection (for Firestore access)

**Solutions:**
- Check error message for specific issue
- Verify date range contains data
- Ensure storage permissions are granted
- Try a smaller date range
- Restart the app

### Cannot Open Export File

**Possible Causes:**
1. **No compatible app installed** - Install PDF reader or spreadsheet app

- Check if file exists in storage

### Share Function Not Working

**Possible Causes:**
1. **No sharing apps available** - Install email or messaging app
2. **File permissions issue** - FileProvider configuration error
3. **File too large** - Some apps have size limits

**Solutions:**
