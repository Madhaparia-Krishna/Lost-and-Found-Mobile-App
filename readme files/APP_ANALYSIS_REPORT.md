## ⚠️ **MINOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **1. Deprecation Warnings (Non-Critical)**
```
- GoogleSignIn APIs (deprecated but functional)
- getSerializable() method (deprecated but functional)
- String.capitalize() (deprecated but functional)
```
**Impact:** Low - App functions normally, but should be updated for future Android versions.

### **2. Missing String Resource**
```xml
<!-- In strings.xml, this is set to placeholder: -->
<string name="default_web_client_id" translatable="false">YOUR_DEFAULT_WEB_CLIENT_ID</string>
```
**Impact:** Medium - Google Sign-In may not work without proper web client ID.

### **3. Hardcoded Admin Email**
```kotlin
// Admin check is hardcoded in multiple places:
if (auth.currentUser?.email == "admin@gmail.com")
```
**Impact:** Low - Works for current setup, but not scalable for multiple admins.

---

## 🚀 **TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Immediate Testing Priority:**

1. **Firebase Connection Test**
   ```bash
   # Build and install
   ./gradlew app:installDebug
   
   # Monitor Firebase logs
   adb logcat | grep -E "(Firebase|Firestore|FirebaseAuth)"
   ```

2. **Authentication Flow Test**
   - Test admin login with `admin@gmail.com`
   - Test regular user registration and login
   - Verify role-based routing

3. **Core Functionality Test**
   - Test item reporting (lost/found)
   - Verify data persistence in Firestore
   - Test admin dashboard access

### **Required Setup Before Testing:**

1. **Update Google Sign-In Configuration:**
   ```xml
   <!-- Replace in strings.xml -->
   <string name="default_web_client_id">YOUR_ACTUAL_WEB_CLIENT_ID</string>
   ```

2. **Create Test Accounts:**
   - Admin: `admin@gmail.com` (with password)
   - Regular user: Any email for testing

3. **Verify Firestore Rules:**
   - Rules are already properly configured
   - Should work out of the box
